# KazTTS
This work presents a cross-domain system for emotion prediction and speech syn- thesis for Kazakh, a low-resource language in AI research. 
 By fine-tuning the ai-
forever/mGPT- 1.3B-Kazakh model for emotion prediction from text inputs and
integrating it with the facebook/mms-tts-kaz and BigVGAN mod- els, we gen-
erate emotionally expressive speech. Leveraging the KazEmoTTS dataset, our
approach demonstrates high emotion prediction accuracy and enhanced natural-
ness in synthesized speech, bridging a critical gap in Kazakh language resources.
